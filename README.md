# Tanks, Tanks, & more Tanks

## Overview

The application is currently dirt simple. When you open up index.html, you can move around with WASD,
and rotate around with the left and right arrow keys.

### General Guidelines

Please read through the resources available at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL
(specifically, their "Development Topics" section) in order to learn a decent amount about WebGL.

Please also note that this project's indentation style is 4 spaces (no tabs!). :)

Unfortunately, this project at the moment seems to limited to Chrome (on my Mac, Firefox chokes,
and Safari refuses to load WebGL).
